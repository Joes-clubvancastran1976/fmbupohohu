I just stumbled out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Antes del cuerpo, and oh boy, where do I even begin? I mean, it’s like my brain is trying to knit a sweater with spaghetti, thoughts all tangled and slipping through my fingers. First off, they really should’ve handed out tissues at the entrance because, seriously, who knew one 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 could yank at your heartstrings like they’re trying to start a lawnmower?

The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 just, I don't know, drags you through this maze of emotions like you’re a stray balloon in a hailstorm. It's deep and dizzying, and I’m still processing everything. I think my popcorn went in cold during that scene when the protagonist just stood there, holding that photograph, and the music sort of swelled in a way that made time feel all stretchy. 

> I was expecting something artsy-fartsy, honestly, but it hit different. Not in an Oh, I wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again and again kind of way – more like, I'm glad I survived that emotional workout. It's that raw wound kind of feeling, like you accidentally picked at a scab and now you gotta deal with the blood and questions of your own mortality. Ha, see what I did there? A body  , and I’m talking about wounds. Clever me.

Speaking of scenes, at some point the cinematography got so intimate it was like I was intruding on someone's private breakdown. Uncomfortable, but electrifying in that masochistic way we're all kinda addicted to. The actors weren't acting. They were living, breathing contradictions of beauty and despair, and now I sound like someone describing wine at a too-expensive restaurant …yikes. 

Okay, side note, I couldn’t help wondering if I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later, maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again when I'm less frazzled and more coherent. Could be fun or depressing—I haven’t decided which yet. But hey, it’s not all doom and gloom. There were moments of light scattered like those annoying breadcrumbs on your bed that won’t go away.

```csharp
public void FeelEverything() {
    string emotions = confused, amazed, exhausted;
    Console.WriteLine($Current State: {emotions});
}
```

And how about that ending? A door half open with an exit sign glowing above it felt like a metaphor shouting at you with a 𝘮𝘦𝘨𝘢phone, but then again, it also made me kinda hungry for a greasy burger. Like I said, spaghetti brain.

So yeah, Antes del cuerpo was a trip, and not the vacation kind. If anyone’s brave enough to dive into it, don't forget to bring your metaphorical floaties. You'll need them, trust me.
